# Smart Pension Tech Test

## Setting up

After cloning repository with `git clone git@github.com:smartpension/smart-cs-support-test.git`, I realised that I am unable to open the files with Atom.

Following the instructions to run the application, using the command `bin/setup`. I was prompted to update my yarn version. The gem dependencies and databases were set up via the bundle installation.

I started the Rails server by typing `rails s` into the terminal.
